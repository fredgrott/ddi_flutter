# Basic idea here is something easy reachable for the beginning
# flutter developer as far as automating some dev ops
# basics to get more feedback during coding
# sprints to enable the potential developer
# to pick up flutter and dart concepts faster
#
# derry can operate two ways, but we just use commandline to
# execute the full derry.yaml set of scripts as command-line of:
# derry build
# derry doc is a separate script that can be run via commandline as:
# derry doc
#
# note since pub is on my path via dark sdk path
# no need to specific pub run stuff to run binaries
# just the binary name suffices

# SIDE NOTE: How did I come up with this organized shit?!
#            You sit there and start playing with all the
#            individual binaries you have to execute to get
#            the full build of the project and all the feedback
#            in the form of api-docs, uml, test reports, etc.
#            Than you rest your eyes and step back and than
#            you can figure our how one should organize it.

# Planning reports dirs structures
# reports
#     coverage
#     uml
#     test
#
# code metrics does not have a dir arg parameter setting as of
# yet. Using this as I can reduce some instruction execution in
# derry and make things more effective with less instructions.
# At this point assume that individual processes do their
# own directory and file clean-up after every run and re-run.

# Toolchain dev process:
#                       1 separate platform specific tasks
#                       2 wire up to build_runner and such via derry
#                       3 wire up the separate platform tasks via IDE task integration
#                       4 eventually write dar scripts to detect platform and handle
#                         plat diffs and then integrate with grinder and at point 
#                         workflow is fully dartized

# This is needed so that the build is integrated with derry scripts
# Depending upon you workflow you may want to add a test node too 
# this list of scripts run on the build node
