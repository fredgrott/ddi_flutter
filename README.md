# Deep Dive Into Flutter

![Deep Dive Into Flutter Image Header](./media/deep-dive-into-flutter.jpg)

This my more formalized version of a Rosetta Stone of Flutter Demos to encourage you to take a deep dive into flutter to master Flutter and Dart for Front-End app development and design. It's also a starting point into my Deep Dive Into Flutter App Development Book Series.

## Code Covers

- Boilerplate, first steps in getting feedback through app exceptions, logging, zone grouping of app exceptions, etc.

- Crossplatform, first steps into the platform widgets strategy of automating the boilerplate for crossplatform UIs in flutter to avoid having to write screens twice; once for material and once for cupertino.

- ArchStateExplore, an exploration of the different arch and state strategies to state management.

## OOP and FP Covered


## Design Covered
